# Chess Game

This project is a Chess game implementation with a clear separation between game logic (**ChessLogic**) and user interface (**ChessUI**). It provides a fully functional chess game with support for all standard rules, including special moves like castling, en passant, and pawn promotion.

## Features
- **ChessLogic**: Handles all game rules, move validation, and board state management.
- **ChessUI**: Provides a graphical interface for interacting with the game, including piece movement, move highlighting, and turn indication.
- **Supported Moves**: Normal moves, castling, en passant, pawn promotion, and more.
- **Game Over Detection**: Checks for checkmate, stalemate, and other endgame conditions.
